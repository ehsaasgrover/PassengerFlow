## Collision Detection Implementation for the AUT Industrial Project ENSE891
In order to achieve the collision detection for our Industrial Project's Simulation, the team has created this repository to implement the collision detection algorithms using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. We are using the Visual Studio Code editor for development.

This project is a partnership between students from the Auckland University of Technology and Daifuku Oceania.

## How to compile
To run the simulation in the HTML5 Canvas
